# Documentation: Tutorial - Create a Go module

This is the first part of a tutorial that introduces a few fundamental features of the Go language. If you're just getting started with Go, be sure to take a look at Tutorial: Get started with Go, which introduces the go command, Go modules, and very simple Go code.

## How to run the projects?

To run the projects, you need to have the Go installed on your machine. If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

## What I studied here?

- [x] Preface
  - [x] Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module (`create-module` folder).
  - [x] Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module (`call-module-code` folder).
  - [x] Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling (`handle-errors` folder).
  - [x] Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays) (`random-greeting` folder).
  - [x] Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map (`greetings-multiple-people` folder).
  - [x] Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code (`call-module-code` folder).
  - [x] Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally (`call-module-code` folder).
